# Bitcoin Analysis Project

## Overview

In this GitHub repository, we will apply statistical analysis techniques learned during our undergraduate statistics course. The primary focus of this project is to analyze the correlation between Bitcoin's price and the time since its last halving. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of other markets on cryptocurrency through the VIX indicator.

## Bitcoin and Blockchain: Key Concepts

1. **Bitcoin as a Cryptocurrency:**
   - Bitcoin is currently the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency. Created in 2009 by an individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it was the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without a central authority.

2. **Blockchain Technology:**
   - The core technology behind Bitcoin is the Blockchain. A Blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a set of verified transactions. All transactions ever made with Bitcoin are recorded in these blocks.

3. **Decentralization and Security:**
   - The Bitcoin Blockchain is decentralized, meaning it is not stored on a single server or controlled by a single entity. Instead, it is replicated across thousands of computers (nodes) worldwide. This decentralization prevents any single entity from tampering with the data, as altering one block would require changing all subsequent blocks on more than 50% of the nodes, which is virtually impossible due to the high level of cryptographic security involved.

4. **Mining and Rewards:**
   - New blocks in the Bitcoin Blockchain are created through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems. This process is computationally intensive and consumes a significant amount of energy.
   - To incentivize miners to contribute their resources, Bitcoin offers rewards in the form of newly created Bitcoins. Initially, the reward per block was 50 Bitcoins. This amount is halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years) in an event known as "halving."

5. **Halving Events:**
   - The halving event reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half, controlling the issuance of new Bitcoins and limiting the total supply to 21 million Bitcoins.
   - Since Bitcoin's inception, three halving events have occurred, reducing the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, then to 12.5 BTC, and currently to 6.25 BTC per block.

## Project Goals

1. **Analyze the Correlation Between Bitcoin's Price and Time Since Last Halving:**
   - We will use statistical methods to examine how Bitcoin's price is affected by the time elapsed since the last halving event.

2. **Impact of Other Markets on Cryptocurrency Using the VIX Indicator:**
   - We will investigate how other financial markets impact cryptocurrency prices, focusing on the VIX (Volatility Index) as a key indicator.
